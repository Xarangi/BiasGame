This imaginative play fostered her love for learning, particularly about different cultures and eras. However, Emily's practical side was influenced by her parents, who emphasized the importance of balancing dreams with realistic goals.\n\nIn university, Emily chose the seminar not solely for academic excellence but to fulfill a credit requirement while enjoying the subject matter.
